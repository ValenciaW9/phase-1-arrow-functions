// Instructions Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62. Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0. Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.
//Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20.. can you help? so far i have this.multiply = num 1 * num2 random = Math.floor(math.random) * 100) + 1; mod = num3 % num4 Math.max()
//To solve this problem, you need to make a few adjustments to your code. Let's go step by step.
//Step 1: Create a variable called multiply that multiplies num1 and num2 to get a result of 62.
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2;
console.log(multiply); // Output: 62
Step 2: Create a variable called random that generates a random integer greater than 0.
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
console.log(random); // Output: random number between 1 and 100
Step 3: Create a variable called mod that calculates the remainder of dividing num3 by num4. The remainder should be 4.
let num3 = 14;
let num4 = 5;
let mod = num3 % num4;
console.log(mod); // Output: 4
Step 4: Use the Math.max() function to find the highest number in a set. In your case, you want to find the highest number among a given set of numbers, which is 20. You need to pass all the numbers as arguments to the Math.max() function.
let max = Math.max(10, 20, 5);
console.log(max); // Output: 20
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.



let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = nim1 * num2;
console.log(multiply); //Output: 62
let random =Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
console.log(random); //  Output: random number between 1 and 100
let num3 = 14;
let num4 = 5;
let mod = num3 % num4;
console.log(mod); //Output: 4
let max = Math.max(10, 20, 5);
console.log(max); //Output 20
